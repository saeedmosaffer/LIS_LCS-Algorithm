The LED Power Optimization Application is a JavaFX desktop tool designed by Saeed Mosaffer for optimizing LED power consumption. It enables users to upload LED configuration data, calculate the longest common subsequence (LCS), and determine the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for efficient power usage. The user-friendly interface, dynamic programming algorithms, and clear results presentation make it a valuable tool for LED power optimization.
